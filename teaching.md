I am the Fall 2015 instructor for the Pre-MAP seminar. See [here](http://kgarofali.github.io/Pre-MAP/) for my personal class website, and [here](http://www.astro.washington.edu/users/premap/) for the general program website.  

I am currently an instructor at the Robinson Center as part of their Saturday
Enrichment Program. My course for Winter 2016 is entitled "Alien Worlds," and the
course website can be found [here](http://kgarofali.github.io/robinson-center/).
