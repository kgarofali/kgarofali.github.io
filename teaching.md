I was the Summer 2017 instructor for [Astro 101](https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1166491) (UW login required). From 2015-2016 I was an instructor at the Robinson Center for Young Scholars as part of their Saturday
Enrichment Program where I developed courses on topics from the solar system, to exoplanets, to stellar evolution for K-8 students. Information about my past Saturday classes can be found [here](http://kgarofali.github.io/robinson-center/). I was also the Fall 2015 instructor for the Pre-Major in Astronomy Program (Pre-MAP) seminar, for which I developed course materials pertaining to research methods (programming in python, reading scientific articles, etc.), as well as professional development (writing research statements, giving scientific presentations, etc.) for freshman students at UW. See [here](http://kgarofali.github.io/Pre-MAP/) for my personal class website, and [here](http://depts.washington.edu/premap/) for the general program website.
