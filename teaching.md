From 2015-2016 I was an instructor at the Robinson Center as part of their Saturday
Enrichment Program. Information about my past Saturday classes can be found [here](http://kgarofali.github.io/robinson-center/). I was also the Fall 2015 instructor for the Pre-MAP seminar. See [here](http://kgarofali.github.io/Pre-MAP/) for my personal class website, and [here](http://depts.washington.edu/premap/) for the general program website.
