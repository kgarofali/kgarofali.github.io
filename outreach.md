I am co-founder of [Astronomy on Tap](http://astronomyontap.org/) (AoT) in [Seattle](https://www.facebook.com/AoTSeattle), a free monthly outreach event featuring astronomy-themed talks and trivia at a local brewery. AoT Seattle has been holding events since March 2015, and now regularly draws crowds of over 200 astro-enthusiasts each month. All events are now live-streamed, as well as recorded on our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXT72Io5VlTXXJrpPezFj0A/videos). From 2015-2017 I also served as the coordinator for the [University of Washington Planetarium](http://depts.washington.edu/astron/outreach/uw-planetarium/). Please feel free to [contact](../../) me with inquiries related to astronomy outreach and education!
