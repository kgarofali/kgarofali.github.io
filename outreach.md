I am a co-organizer of [Astronomy on Tap](http://astronomyontap.org/) (AoT) in [Seattle](https://www.facebook.com/AoTSeattle), a free monthly outreach event featuring astronomy-themed talks and trivia at a local brewery. AoT Seattle has been holding events since March 2015, and now regularly draws crowds of over 200 astro-enthusiasts each month. In addition, I am the current coordinator for the [University of Washington Planetarium](http://depts.washington.edu/astron/outreach/uw-planetarium/). Please feel free to [contact](../../) me with inquiries related to Astronomy on Tap Seattle or the planetarium!
