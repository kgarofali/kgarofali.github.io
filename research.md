Broadly, my research interests are in probing massive star and binary evolution from the X-ray perspective. More specifically, I study objects like high-mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs) and supernova remnants (SNRs) (latest SNR paper [here](../docs/SNRpaper.pdf)) in order to learn more about the life and death cycles of massive stars, and the effects of binaries on massive star evolution. For my thesis, I am focused on probing these populations in nearby, star-forming spiral M33 using *Chandra*, *Hubble*, and *XMM-Newton* data.

Cyan crosses are X-ray sources from Tullmann et al.

There are 286 X-ray sources covered by 91 <i>HST</i> fields. The next two frames are zoom-ins on one portion of an RGB (F814W,F606W, blue equivalent) rendered <i>HST</i> ACS field with the X-ray error circle (0.7") shown in white, and the position of the candidate optical counterpart denoted by the white arrow.</font></td></tr>

High-mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs) provide an exciting window into the impact of mass transfer on massive star evolution. They are also likely progenitors of gamma-ray bursts and gravitational wave events, and may be an important source of feedback in the early universe. Part of my thesis is focused on the identification and characterization of the HMXB population in M33. By leveraging archival data from both *Chandra* and the *Hubble Space Telescope (HST)*, we are able to identify HMXB candidates and their potential optical counterparts after careful astrometric alignment, and measure HMXB ages to ~5 Myr precision from fits to the color-magnitude diagrams of the surrounding stars, which yield the star formation histories (SFHs) of the surrounding region. Furthermore, we can use a combination of the X-ray and optical characteristics of the HMXBs to constrain physical parameters for some of the HMXBs, including potential periods and companion masses in addition to ages. The distribution of these parameters for the population of HMXBs can be directly compared to models of HMXB production expected from the known SFH of M33. These comparisons put new constraints on prescriptions used by binary population synthesis models which attempt to map the characteristics of the parent population to the resulting HMXBs. An image of our M33 archival coverage is shown above, and HMXB age recovery method is illustrated in the figure below.<br>
