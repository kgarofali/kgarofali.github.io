My research focuses on observations of extragalactic X-ray binary (XRB) populations. XRBs are systems containing a compact object (black hole or neutron star) accreting material from a less evolved stellar companion through stellar winds or Roche lobe overflow. As such, XRBs are X-ray bright snapshots of the complex evolution of binaries, and they encode information not only about the past history of binary evolution, but also compact object populations and the physics of accretion.

In particular, I am interested in the effect of metallicity and stellar population age on XRB evolution as measured from galaxy-integrated X-ray spectral energy distributions of star-forming galaxies, and XRB luminosity functions. A list of my publications can be found [here](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-abs_connect?return_req=no_params&author=Garofali,%20Kristen%20R.%20A.&db_key=PR).
