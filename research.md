Broadly, my research interests are in high-energy astronomy studying objects like high-mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs) and supernova remnants (SNRs). More specifically, I am interested in identifying and characterizing HMXB populations in nearby galaxies using both the *Chandra* and *Hubble* Space Telescopes. This kind of work can provide better observational constraints on population synthesis models for interacting binary stars.

In particular, I am looking at HMXBs in the nearby star-forming Triangulum Galaxy (M33). Currently there are only 3 HMXBs that have been identified and characterized in M33, all of which are extremely interesting. Through careful astrometric alignment of *Hubble* and *Chandra* observations of M33 it is possible to identify 
over 10 times that number.<br>

Once identified, each HMXB can be assigned an age and type based on the *Hubble*
observations of that particular field. The star formation histories (SFHs) of the field surrounding the HMXB can also be determined. The combination of all this information provides constraints for the mass function of binary companions, the dominant type of HMXB, and the age distribution of HMXBs that must be reproduced by theoretical binary population synthesis models.<br>
