My research interests lie in probing massive star and binary evolution using resolved X-ray source populations in nearby galaxies. Massive stars are catalysts in the cycle of star formation, feedback, galactic chemical evolution, and compact object formation so understanding their evolution, in particular the end stages of their lifetimes, is of great importance to a broad range of astrophysics. A list of my publications can be found [here](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-abs_connect?return_req=no_params&author=Garofali,%20Kristen%20R.%20A.&db_key=PR).

In particular, I study high-mass X-ray binary (HMXB) and supernova remnant (SNR) populations in nearby galaxies using a combination of *Chandra*, *XMM-Newton*, and the *Hubble Space Telescope (HST)* in order to learn more about the life and death cycles of massive stars, the effects of multiplicity on massive star evolution, and the influence of host galaxy properties such as metallicity, star formation history, and star formation rate on the observed populations.

My most recent work has focused on the HMXB population in M33, which we have identified and characterized using a combination of *Chandra*, *HST*, and *XMM-Newton*. We leverage archival data from both *Chandra* and the *Hubble Space Telescope* to identify HMXB candidates and their potential donor star counterparts (below gif). We can then measure ages for these candidate HMXBs using the surrounding stellar population as a clock. Modeling the color-magnitude diagram of the stellar population in the vicinity of a young source, such as an HMXB, yields a star formation history for that region and thus a formation timescale, or age, for that source.
